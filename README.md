The Bash Command Line
===================== f

![*Tux, the Linux penguin*](tux.png)

This tutorial makes you familiar with **bash**, the Linux command line. You will learn to:

* navigate directories
* manipulate files
* execute programs

If you have no previous experience with Unix-like
systems or know a few commands but would like to know more, this tutorial is for you.

### Prerequisites

*This tutorial was prepared for Ubuntu Linux, but it works on MacOS,
Cygwin and the Git bash as well, given that Python 3 is installed on
your system.*

----

## Goal

In this tutorial, you will be looking for a word with 22 characters:

![](solution.png)

All characters are hidden in the exercises below.

## Preparations

* clone the repository or download the code as a ZIP file
* locate the  `exercises/` folder
* open a `bash` terminal

![](preparations.png)

----

## 1. Directories and files


### 1.1. Navigating directories

The **first character** is hidden in a file somewhere in the *exercise1*
directory tree. Use the commands

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
cd <directory_name>
```

(do not type the pointy brackets, just insert the directory name) and

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ls
```

to move from one directory to the next. Look through subdirectories
until you find one with the name `solution_1.1` and list its contents.
If you went to a wrong directory, you can go back one level by typing:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
cd ..
```

or go back to your home folder:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
cd
```

### 1.2. Show a hidden file

Some files are not visible immediately. To see them, you need the
command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ls -a
```

The **second character**, is in the same directory as the first one, but
in a hidden file.

### 1.3. Execute a program

Use cd .. to go back to the directory `exercise_1/directoryB/`. When
listing its contents, you should see a **shell script file**
`program.sh`. To find the **third character**, you need to execute the
program. On bash, this is done by typing source and the name of the
program:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
source program.sh
```

### 1.4. Find out how big a file is

Go to the folder `exercise_1/directoryC/`. To find **the fourth
character**, you need to find out how big the text file in the directory
is. This is done with the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ls -l
```

In the table the command produces, you will find the file size in bytes,
the fileâ€™s owner, permissions to read and modify it, and the date/time
of the last modification.

To obtain the fourth character look up the file size in the [Table of
printable ASCII
characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters):

![](ASCII-Table-wide.svg)

*ASCII Table, Public Domain*

<div class="admonition hint">

When typing names of directories or files, press `[TAB]` after the first
few characters. Unix tries to guess what you are typing.

</div>

----

## 2. Edit text files

Please use `cd ..` to go back to the top directory of the tutorial
material. Then, change to the directory `exercise_2`.

### 2.1. See what is in a text file

In the directory *exercise\_2/*, you will find a text file
*solution\_2.1.txt*. The **fifth character** is inside that file. To see
its contents, use the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
less <filename>
```

### 2.2. Edit text files

To get **character number six**, you will need to create a text file in
the `exercise_2` directory. On Ubuntu, you can do this using the editor
`nano`. You can start it typing the name of the program, or

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
nano <filename>
```

**To exit nano, type Ctrl-X**

Create a text file with the characters you have found so far.

The **sixth character** is the one you need to press to save a file in
`nano`.

<div class="admonition hint">

If you want to know more about a particular command, type

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
man <command>
```

You get shown a help page that you can leave by pressing 'q'.

</div>

----

## 3. Copy and remove files

Please go to the directory exercise\_3.

### 3.1. Create a directory and copy a file to it.

To find **characters seven and eight**, you need to create a
subdirectory named *solution* in `exercise_3/` and copy the files from
the `part1/` and `part2/` folders into it.

For creating directories, use the command:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
mkdir <directory name>
```

For copying, you can use the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
cp <filename from> <filename to>
```

Type `ls -l solution/*` afterwards to see the solution.

### 3.2. Removing files

In the `data` directory, all files with an `Y` need to be deleted. To do
so, use the command:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
rm <filename>
```

Also, there are more files to be deleted in the *data* directory. To
remove more than one file at once, you can use `*` as a wildcard, i.e.
`rm ju*` will delete all of `junk.txt, juniper.txt` and `june.docx`.

To get **characters nine and ten**, look at the files that remain after
deleting all that contain a `Y`.

<div class="admonition hint">

To remove an empty directory, you can use

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
rmdir <directory name>
```

The command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
rm -r <directory name>
```

deletes a directory and everything in it.

</div>

<div class="admonition warning">

On Unix, it is not possible to undelete files!

This makes removing files with the `*` symbol **very** dangerous,
because you could wipe out everything with a single command (e.g. if you
type the wrong directory by accident). Backups become an even better
idea after learning this command.

</div>

----

## 4. Process text data

Please go to the directory exercise\_4.

### 4.1. comparing two files

There are two different versions of a quote, `ai.txt`, and
`artificial_intelligence.txt`. To find out, how they differ, Unix
provides the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
diff <filename1> <filename2>
```

Of course, you can look at the text first using `less` or `nano`. The
**11th character** of the solution is the single character in which the
two files differ.

### 4.2. Sorting a text file

Unix has a small program to sort text files alphabetically. It is called
by

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
less <filename> | sort
```

The symbol '|' is called a pipe and is often used to connect Unix
programs to each other. The **12th character** of the solution is the
first character of the last word in the alphabetically sorted file
elephant.txt.

<div class="admonition hint">

To store the sorted lines in a new file, you can add an output file,
like

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
less <filename> | sort > result.txt
```

</div>

### 4.3. Finding words in a text file

To look for specific words in a text file, use the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
grep <word> <filename>
```

It produces all lines from the given file that contain the given word.
The `grep` command is very powerful and can handle Regular Expressions.

To find the **13th character**, search for the word **fire** in the file
`datascience.txt` and take the **first** character of the output.

<div class="admonition hint">

You can search through many files at once by including a \* in the
filename.

</div>

<div class="admonition warning">

The last two exercises may not work on Git Bash.

</div>

----

## 5. Unzip files

Please go to the directory exercise\_5.

### 5.1. unzipping archives

Unzipping compressed files is a very basic and important task. On Unix,
you often encounter WinZip archives, .tar archives and .gz compressed
files. For unpacking Win zip files, use

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
unzip <filename>
```

for .tar and .tar.gz files

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
tar -xf <filename>
```

and for .gz files,

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
gunzip <filename>
```

The **14th and 15th character** of the solution are in a multiply
wrapped archive in the exercise\_5 directory.

<div class="admonition hint">

To pack a directory and everything within, you can use the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
tar -cf backup.tar <directory>
```

To subsequently compress it, use

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
gzip backup.tar
```

</div>

----

## 6. Command-line tools

Please go to the directory `exercise_6`.

### 6.1. Changing file access rights

Each file on Unix has separate permissions for reading 'r', writing 'w',
and executing 'x'. Displaying them with:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ls -l
```

There is one triplet of permissions for the owner of the file owner, one
triplet for a group of users, and one for all others. The `chmod`
command allows to change these permissions, e.g.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
chmod a+x <filename>
```

grants all users the permission to execute a file, while chmod u-w
forbids the current user (oneself) to write to the file (thereby
protecting it from being deleted accidentally).

To see **characters 16+17** of the solution, make the program
`permissions.sh` executable. Then execute it with:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
./permissions.sh
```

<div class="admonition hint">

You can grant permissions for a whole directory tree using

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
chmod -R a+x <directory>
```

</div>

### 6.2. How much disk space have I left?

To find out, how much disk space you have left, you can use the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
df
```

`df` lists all hard drive partitions, CD-ROMs, pendrives and some
logical partitions Unix uses. All numbers are given in kilobyte (1000
byte or one 1000000th GB).

To obtain the **18th character**, check out the version of the `df`
program. Find out how to do that with:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
df --help
```

The solution is the last character of the first authors' first name.

### 6.3. Set an environment variable

To install some programs, it is necessary to set so-called environment
variables. These can be set using the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
export <variable-name>=<value>
```

You can see all variables by the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
env
```

To obtain the **19th character**, you need to use `export` to set the
variable *GIVEME* to the value **SOLUTION**.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
echo $GIVEME
```

Find out the **characters position in the alphabet** with:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
echo $GIVEME | wc -c
```

<div class="admonition hint">

By default, changes to environment variables only affect the current
terminal.

If you want to set environment variables for each console window, write
the export command to the file `.bashrc` in your home directory (it is a
hidden file).

</div>

### 6.4. Check whether you have internet

The easiest way to check from the Unix command line whether the internet
connection works, is to send a request to a known server (e.g.
www.spiced-academy.com) using the command

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ping <web address>
```

The command reports, how long a message takes back and forth to the
given server. To interrupt the messages, press Ctrl+C. You can use the
program

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
./check_ping
```

The **20th character** is the `ping` option that sets the maximum number
of requests sent. Check the documentation with:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
man ping
```

### 6.5. Managing processes

To see what programs are running on your machine, type

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
top
```

It displays you a list of all currently active programs. *Shift+P* sorts
them by the CPU time they are using, *Shift+M* by the amount of memory
they are using (if you don't see any program consuming lots of memory,
start a web browser). Quit `top` by pressing *q*.

The **last two characters** of the solution are the first two characters
of the second word in the line containing the column labels.

<div class="admonition hint">

If you want to get rid of one of the programs you started (e.g. because
it crashed), you can do so by typing

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
kill -s 9 <pid>
```

</div>

You find the pid number in the first column of the *top* output. Of
course, you may only interrupt your own programs, not those owned by
*root*, the system administrator.
